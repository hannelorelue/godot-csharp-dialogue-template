Dialogues can be read from JSON and TSV files.

## The ScenePlayer

ScenePlayer displays and manages a dialogue scene. Instantiate this scene as a child of your game window, load your timeline with Timeline.LoadTimeline and start your dialogue with the ScenePlayer RunScene method.

## Timeline

The Timeline class provides a method to load dialogue data from TSV and JSON and a custom TimelineEvent class for the scene data.

### TimelineEvent Fields

TimelineEvents can be expanded and restructured depending on your needs. Here are some of the default fields.

`Eventid`: Unique int id, used as the key in SceneData dictionary. Every Scene has to start with Eventid 0 and end with -1

`Next`: Eventid of the next event

`Line`: Text that is displayed in textbox

`ChoiceLabel`: Text of the choice button

`Choices`: list of choice Eventids

`Character`: character Id; if none is specified, the narrator resource will be loaded

`Animation`: character animation; enter, leave

`Position`: "outer_right", "right",  "middle", "left", "outer_left";
